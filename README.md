Among the tasks of implementing an information system, data modeling is a major 
one. It must consider both functional constraints (better response to the business 
user, etc.) and technical constraints (readability and evolution of the model, etc.). This 
type of modeling highlights the activities that the user wishes to analyze, and the 
dimensions that allow him to explore the data through different axes of analysis.
To design a data model, the prime contractor has every interest in starting from the 
model of the business process concerned. This allows him to have the exhaustiveness 
of the activities, the information exchanged between them through the interfaces, 
and the specificities of the trades.
This approach provides a cross-functional vision of the company's objectives broken 
down into action plans and performance measurement indicators.
